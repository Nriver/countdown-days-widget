# Why I made this?

I find it useful to have an idea of how many days are left until a certain event. This way, I can keep track of how much time I have before an exam or how many days I need to work until my next big vacation or perhaps just someone's birthday.

Additionally, when I look back at my old journals, I sometimes come across moments when I did something stupid or interesting, and I wonder, "How long ago did I do that?" Oh, goodness, it's already been over 1000 days since I started https://github.com/Nriver/trilium-translation ?

Well, just for fun.
